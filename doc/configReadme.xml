As a Workday admin I want to migrate workers to Salesfoce.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating Worker from Workday instance to Salesforce, being able to specify filtering criterias and desired behaviour when a user already exists in the destination system.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Anypoint Template will go to the Workday and query all the existing active workers that match the filter criteria. The criteria is based on manipulations starting from the given date.
The last step of the Process stage will group the workers and create them in Salesforce.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch excecution.

There are a couple of things you should take into account before running this Anypoint Template:
1. **Users cannot be deleted in SalesForce:** For now, the only thing to do regarding users removal is disabling/deactivating them, but this won't make the username available for a new user.
2. **Each user needs to be associated to a Profile:** SalesForce's profiles are what define the permissions the user will have for manipulating data and other users. Each SalesForce account has its own profiles. In this Anypoint Template you will find a processor labeled *setup Worker for upsert* where to set your Profile Ids from the source account. Note that for the integration test to run properly, you should change the constant *sfdc.profileId* in *mule.test.properties* to one that's valid in your source organization.
3. **Working with sandboxes for the same account**: Although each sandbox should be a completely different environment, Usernames cannot be repeated in different sandboxes, i.e. if you have a user with username *bob.dylan* in *sandbox A*, you will not be able to create another user with username *bob.dylan* in *sandbox B*. If you are indeed working with Sandboxes for the same SalesForce account you will need to map the source username to a different one in the target sandbox, for this purpose, please refer to the processor labeled *setup Worker for upsert*.
4. **Workday email uniqueness**: The email can be repeated for two or more accounts (or missing). Therefore Workday accounts with duplicate emails will be removed from processing in the Input stage.

In any of the ways you would like to run this Anypoint Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Batch Process initiated</h1>
<b>ID:</b>6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e<br/>
<b>Records to Be Processed: </b>9<br/>

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `wdayworkermigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://wdayworkermigration.cloudhub.io/migrateworkers` and report will be sent to the email configured.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/migrateworkers` and this will output a summary report and send it in the mail.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Users to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Users are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Anypoint Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

$H$H#  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateworkers` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Workers migrated and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Anypoint Template the *mainFlow* just executes the Batch Job which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
